1. I have shifted connections.put() on th server side towards the end due to the bug.
  - because I was getting Error Java net Socketexception connection reset error, which occurs, when, when peers receive data it cant proces. 
  - There are 2 fixes available
    - put connections.put(), down
    - or put a timer.sleep() in the reader thread strart. 


2.               // if (!peer.isChoked()) {
              // peer.choke();
              // peer.sendMessage(CHOKE);
              // } --> in NOT_INTERESTED



3. -----------------------------------
          // Thread.sleep(5000);
          // System.exit(0);
    in reader thread...



4. ----------------------------------------

After the file is transfered peer remains UNCHOKED, because of that the sender will not send message.

After download is completed. 

INTERESTED = is not changed. (this could be modified)
CHOKED = false
