In future we will supply peerID as well. 

Compile javac peerProcess.java
Execute java peerProcess.java 1001 
Where 1001 represents the peerID.

To run the project, run the file using steps above for each of the peers in a separate terminal from 1001 to 1006 sequentially

Peer 1001 has the file and will serve as the intial file sharer.
